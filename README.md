 # Design Decisions
 Tried to follow the atomic design appoarch as all the similar logics/files are put under one folder/file
 * for example all the component for calender are stored in calender folder only
 * all utility/helper files are saved in utils folder only
 * only code needed to for that component is kept in each component.
